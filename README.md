# Reffie.me Interview Round Automation Test Project

This is the take-home test project "Interview Round Automation" - only the frontend side

The requirement is [here](./Take%20Home%20Interview%20-%20Frontend%20Engineer%20-%20version%20A.pdf)

My Tech design is [here](./TechDesign.md). The features implemented in the MVP are marked by check(âœ…) in the Tech design.

## Steps to Run

This project is built by `React + TypeScript + Vite`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikosamofa/reffie-me-interview-round-automation-react-ts.git
cd reffie-me-interview-round-automation-react-ts
yarn
yarn dev
```

- This project uses localStorage for API mock. Initially, there's no data in the local storage, so you will see text "Fetching...".
- Click button "Reset LocalStorage" on the top left and refresh the page
- The interview automation list will show up. Now play around!
