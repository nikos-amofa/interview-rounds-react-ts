# Interview Rounds Process

This project is to show off my React skillsets

## Steps to Run

This project is built by `React + TypeScript + Vite`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikosamofa/interview-rounds-react-ts.git
cd interview-rounds-react-ts
yarn
yarn dev
```

- This project uses localStorage for API mock. Initially, there's no data in the local storage, so you will see text "Fetching...".
- Click button "Reset LocalStorage" on the top left and refresh the page
- The interview rounds list will show up. Now play around!

## Project description

This project is MVP for interviewers to record the interview status and pass/fail interviewee.

My Tech design is [here](./TechDesign.md). The features implemented in the MVP are marked by check(âœ…) in the Tech design.
